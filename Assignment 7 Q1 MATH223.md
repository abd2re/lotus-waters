# Q1

To prove the given equation in an inner product space $V$, we start by expanding the norms using the inner product properties. For any $u, v \in V$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
||u + v||^2 + ||u - v||^2 &= \langle u + v, u + v \rangle + \langle u - v, u - v \rangle \\
&= \langle u, u \rangle + \langle u, v \rangle + \langle v, u \rangle + \langle v, v \rangle \\
&\quad + \langle u, u \rangle - \langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle + \langle v, v \rangle \\
&= 2\langle u, u \rangle + 2\langle v, v \rangle \\
&= 2||u||^2 + 2||v||^2
\end{aligned}
$$

For $V = \mathbb{R}^2$ with the dot product, this equation represents the parallelogram law: the sum of the squares of the diagonals of a parallelogram equals twice the sum of the squares of its sides. Specifically, if $u$ and $v$ are adjacent sides, then $u + v$ and $u - v$ are the diagonals, and the equation confirms this geometric relationship.
