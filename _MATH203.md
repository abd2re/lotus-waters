We have posted a practice final exam here: [Practice Final](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/dstephens/203/Revision/Math203-2024-F-Practice.pdf "https://www.math.mcgill.ca/dstephens/203/Revision/Math203-2024-F-Practice.pdf") with the Final Formula Sheet [here](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/dstephens/203/Revision/Math203-2024-FormulaSheet-F.pdf "https://www.math.mcgill.ca/dstephens/203/Revision/Math203-2024-FormulaSheet-F.pdf"). Please let me know if you spot any typos.

This practice exam is based on a real exam from 2016.  Please note that

- there will be more representation of the first part of the course (before probability) on this year's exam;
- Q10 is True/False with no working needing to be shown; there will be no questions of this type this year, however, Q10 covers material that is certainly examinable this year.

but other than that the format, style and content of the questions is similar overall to this year's exam.  For example, there will be ten questions each marked out of 10.

We will go through the paper in the next lectures (Thursday and Friday this week), and provide written solutions early next week.
