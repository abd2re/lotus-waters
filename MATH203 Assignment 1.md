#### 1. Incidence of difficult bag-mask ventilation in children
(a) The population of interest are paediatric patients.
(b) The experimental units are the individual children (patients) aged 0-8 years undergoing elective surgery at the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
(c) The sample are the group of patients aged 0-8 years undergoing elective surgery requiring bag-mask ventilation and intubation at the Montreal Children’s Hospital who participated in the study.
(d) The variables recorded or measured for this study are DBMV status (presence or absence) and age of the patient.

This is an **observational study** because the researchers collected data on patients without manipulating any variables or assigning treatments, they simply observed and recorded existing conditions.

#### 2. Do Mountain Bikers Know When They Have Had a Concussion and, Do They Know to Stop Riding?
(a) Age is **quantitative** data.
(b) Gender is **qualitative** data.
(c) Nationality is **qualitative** data
(d) Style of riding is **qualitative** data.
(e) Number of years doing mountain bike racing is **quantitative** data.

#### 3. Oil spills as of 2010.
(a) The recorded variable in this study is the cause of spill of oil tankers.
(b) The recorder variable is **qualitative**.
(c) The general conclusions that may be drawn are that the bar plot shows that groundings were the most common cause of oil spills, followed by collisions. On the other hand, causes such as hull failures and fire & explosions were responsible for a smaller number of spills. This suggests that preventive measures for groundings and collisions could have the greatest impact on reducing oil spills.

#### 4. The effect of protective headgear on head injuries and concussions in adolescent football (soccer) players
The following conclusions can be drawn from the bar plots are that most players across all positions do not wear headgear, especially in the midfield and defense positions, indicating that headgear usage is not common among adolescent soccer players, and that goalkeepers and forwards/strikers have the lowest numbers of players using headgear, while defenders and midfielders show a relatively higher but still small proportion of headgear usage.

#### 5. *The Better Pilot*
(a) The three variables involved in this study are: **the pilot** (A or B), **time of flight** (day or night), and **the number of flights landed on time**.
(b) Pilot A's argument is correct because, when looking at the overall data, she landed 100 flights on time (90 during the day and 10 at night), which is a higher total than Pilot B, who landed only 94 flights on time (19 during the day and 75 at night).
(c) Pilot B's argument is correct when looking at performance based on the time of the flight. For night flights, Pilot B landed 75 out of 100 flights (75%) on time, compared to Pilot A, who only landed 10 out of 20 flights (50%) on time. Similarly, for day flights, Pilot B landed 19 out of 20 on time (95%), compared to Pilot A's 90 out of 100 (90%). So, proportionally, Pilot B has a higher success rate for both day and night flights and has more flights landed on time at night.
(d) The contradictory conclusions arise due to the use of different metrics. Pilot A focuses on the absolute number of flights landed on time, which makes her appear better because she has more total successful landings. However, Pilot B is focusing on proportions (success rate by time of flight), where she outperforms Pilot A in both day and night flight categories. This is an example of **Simpson’s paradox** in which the **confounding factor** is the time of flight, where trends that appear in different groups of data can reverse when the data is combined.

#### 6. *MATH 203 Midterm exam*
(a) There are approximately 80 grades that are between 115 and 125 points.
(b) There are approximately 120 grades that are between 120 and 127.5 points.
(c) The median is greater than the mean because the data is left-skewed, meaning there are a few lower scores pulling the mean down, while the majority of students have higher scores, which raises the median (the mean is sensitive to extreme values whilst the median is not).

#### 7. *Corporate sustainability*
(a) The percentage of the 992 senior managers reported a level of support for sustainability of 100 points or greater is approximately 11%.
(b) The exact value of the sample mean cannot be determined from the histogram alone because the exact data points and frequencies are not available. The histogram only provides approximate visual distributions.
(c) The sample mean and sample median are likely to be similar because the histogram appears to be roughly **symmetric**, indicating a distribution where the mean and median are close to each other.
(d) The exact sample variance cannot be calculated from the histogram. Variance, like the mean, requires the exact data points or at least the individual data groupings and frequencies.
(e) Based on the histogram, the range appears to be from 0 to about 160, as the support level is measured on a scale from 0 to 160 and the histogram spans this entire range.

#### 8. *Does a teaspoon of honey before bed really calm a child’s cough?*
(a) The median improvement score for the honey dosage group is **11**.  
(b) The median improvement score for the DM dosage group is **9**.  
(c) The median improvement score for the control group is **7**.
(d) Based on these results, pediatric researchers can conclude that honey showed the highest median improvement in cough symptoms compared to both the DM and control groups, suggesting that honey may be more effective in relieving cough symptoms than dextromethorphan (DM) or no treatment.

#### 9. *50 most powerful women in America*
(a) The range of the ages of the 50 most powerful women is **34 years**.
(b) The variance of the ages is approximately **36.75 years$^{2}$**.
(c) The standard deviation of the ages is approximately **6.06 years**.
(d) The age data for the United States is less variable compared to Europe, where the standard deviation is given as 10 years. Since the standard deviation in the U.S. is 6.06 years, which is smaller than 10 years, the ages of the most powerful women in Europe are more variable.
(e) If the largest age is omitted, the standard deviation would **decrease**. This is because removing an extreme value (outlier) reduces the spread of the data, leading to a smaller standard deviation. *Verification*: After removing the largest age, the new standard deviation is approximately **5.30 years**, which is lower than the original standard deviation of **6.06 years**. This confirms that the standard deviation decreases when the largest age is omitted.
