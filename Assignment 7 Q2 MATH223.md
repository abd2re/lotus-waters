# Q2

To prove that $T$ is injective, we show that the kernel of $T$ contains only the zero vector. Let $v \in \ker(T)$, so $T(v) = 0$. By the given condition:  
$$
\|T(v)\| = \|v\| \implies \|0\| = \|v\| \implies \|v\| = 0
$$
In an inner product space, the only vector with norm zero is $v = 0$. Thus, $\ker(T) = \{0\}$, proving $T$ is injective.
