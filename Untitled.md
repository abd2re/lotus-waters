In my school's entrepreneurship club, I led a project to build a website for Senegalese students who need career and university advice. Our team initially struggled because we couldn't agree on whether to prioritize quizzes or content, which was causing a standstill. To break the deadlock, I suggested we start with some basic content and then add quizzes as we went along. This compromise brought everyone together and helped us move forward. From this experience, I learned how important it is to find common ground and communicate clearly as a leader. In the future, if I face a similar situation, I will focus on maintaining team unity and aligning our goals to keep things running smoothly. I think this could prepare me for the Goldman Sachs Possibilities Summits program.
