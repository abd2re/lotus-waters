	## Q6

(a)
The regression equation is:
$$
\hat{y} = -2256.36 + 7756.43 \cdot x
$$
where:
- $\hat{y}$: Predicted price of the diamond.
- $x$: Number of carats (size of the diamond).

(b)
The y-intercept is $-2256.36$, representing the predicted price of a diamond when the size ($x$) is 0 carats. This value does not have practical meaning because a diamond cannot have a size of 0 carats. The negative value is a result of the extrapolation of the linear model beyond the observed data range.

(c)
The slope is $7756.43$, and its standard error is $14.07$. The 95% confidence interval is calculated as:

$$
\text{Confidence Interval} = \hat{\beta}_{1} \pm t_{\alpha/2, \text{df}}s_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}
$$
$$
\text{Confidence Interval} = 7756.43 \pm 1.96 \cdot 14.07
$$
$$
\text{Confidence Interval} = (7728.93, 7783.93)
$$
With 95% confidence, the price of a diamond increases between $7728.93$ and $7783.93$ dollars for each additional carat of weight. The interpretation is meaningful only within the observed range of carat values ($0.2$ to $5.01$).

(d)
The residual standard error (standard deviation of random error) is $1549$. This indicates that the actual price of a diamond typically deviates from the predicted price by about $1549$ dollars on average. This reflects that the variability in diamond prices that is not explained by the carat size alone. Other factors likely contribute to this variation.
