# Q5

(a)
In the context of this problem, the null hypothe they consider bribery (and similarly tax evasion).  In other words, under the null, men and women are equally likely to give any of the possible responses (0=always justified through 3=never justified).  



(b)
For the justifiability of corruption responses, the large-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test yielded  
$$
z = -14.10.
$$
On a standard normal table, this is far into the left tail, so the p-value is effectively $< 0.0001$.  In practical terms, it is extremely small (close to zero), so we reject the null hypothesis at any conventional $\alpha$ level.  There is very strong evidence that men's and women's distributions of corruption justifiability responses differ.



(c)
Since women had the larger rank-sum statistic, that indicates that, on average, women gave higher numeric responses (3 = never justified).  Hence, women are less likely to consider corruption acceptable.  Put differently, women tend to be less tolerant of corruption than men.



(d)
For the justifiability of tax evasion, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test yielded  
$$
z = -18.12,
$$
which again corresponds to a p-value $< 0.0001$.  We have overwhelming evidence to reject the null hypothesis that men and women view the justifiability of tax evasion in the same way.



(e)
As in part (c), women again had a higher rank-sum statistic.  Because a higher response (closer to 3) means never justified, this implies women find tax evasion less justifiable than men do.  In short, women appear more opposed to tax evasion than men.
