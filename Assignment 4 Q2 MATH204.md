# Q2

(a)
The scientists want to test whether the median amount of caffeine exceeds 300 milligrams.

- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The median caffeine content is 300 mg.  
  $H_0: \text{Median} = 300$

- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$): The median caffeine content exceeds 300 mg.  
  $H_a: \text{Median} > 300$

(b)
From the six values:
- Values > 300: 564, 498, 303, 307 (4 cups)
- Values $\leq$ 300: 259, 300 (2 cups)
4 cups have caffeine content exceeding 300 mg.

(c)
At $p=0.5, \eta=6$, the probability that at least four of the six cups have caffeine amounts that exceed 300 mg is $1-P(x \leq 3)=1-0.656=0.344$.

(d)
The probability $P(X \geq 4) = 0.344$ at a significance level $\alpha = 0.05$.

Since $0.3438 > 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$. There is not enough evidence to conclude that the median caffeine content exceeds 300 mg.
