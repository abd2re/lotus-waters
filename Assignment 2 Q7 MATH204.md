## Q7

(a)
- Null Hypothesis $H_{0}: \beta_1 = 0$: There is no linear relationship between the asking price and size of the diamond.
- Alternative Hypothesis $H_{a}:\beta_1 > 0$: There is a positive linear relationship between the asking price and size of the diamond.

(b)
P-value for the slope $\beta_1$ is less than $2 \times 10^{-16}$, which is effectively 0.

At $\alpha = 0.05$:
- Decision Rule: Reject $H_{0}$ if $p \leq \alpha$.
- Since $p < 0.05$, we reject $H_{0}$.

There is strong evidence to suggest a significant positive linear relationship between the asking price and size of the diamond.

(c)
- $r^2 = 0.8493$.
- $r = \sqrt{r^2} = \sqrt{0.8493} \approx 0.9216$.

Interpretation:
- $r^2$: Approximately 84.93% of the variation in asking price can be explained by the size of the diamond (number of carats).
- $r$: The correlation coefficient of 0.9216 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between asking price and size.
