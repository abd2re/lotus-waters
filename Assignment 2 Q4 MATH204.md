## Q4

(a)
The 98% confidence interval for the mean hardness of molded items with an elapsed time of 30 hours is:

$$
(227.457, 231.806)
$$

We are 98% confident that the mean hardness of molded items, when the elapsed time is 30 hours, falls between 227.457 and 231.806 Brinell units.

(b)
The 98% prediction interval for the hardness of a newly molded test item with an elapsed time of 30 hours is:

$$
(220.870, 238.393)
$$

We are 98% confident that the hardness of a single newly molded test item, when the elapsed time is 30 hours, falls between 220.870 and 238.393 Brinell units.

(c)
No, the prediction interval in part (b) is wider than the confidence interval in part (a). This is expected because the prediction interval accounts for both the uncertainty in estimating the mean, and the variability of individual observations around the mean. Thus, it is always wider than the confidence interval for the mean at the same confidence level.
