# Q3

(a)
Hypotheses:  
- $H_0$: Distributions are equal.  
- $H_a$: Population 1 is shifted from Population 2 (two-tailed). 

Sample 1 Ranks: 1, 2.5, 2.5, 4.5, 6.5, 6.5, 8.5, 10.5. Sum = 42.5  
Sample 2 Ranks: 4.5, 8.5, 10.5, 12, 13, 14. Sum = 62.5  

- Smaller sample: $n_1 = 6$, $n_2 = 8$.  
- From Table a (row $n_1 = 6$, column $n_2 = 8$): $T_L = 29$, $T_U = 61$.  

Since $62.5 > T_U = 61$, reject $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence at $\alpha = 0.05$ to indicate a shift in the distributions.  

(b)
Hypotheses:  
- $H_0$: Distributions are equal.  
- $H_a$: Population 1 is shifted to the right of Population 2 (one-tailed).  

Test Statistic: Sum of ranks for Sample 2 (smaller sample) = 62.5.  

Critical Value (Table b, Î± = 0.05 one-tailed):  
- $n_1 = 6$, $n_2 = 8$. From Table b: $T_U = 58$.  

Since $62.5 > 58$, do not reject $H_0$. The data does not provide sufficient evidence to indicate that Population 1 is shifted to the right of Population 2.
